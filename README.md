# Training-Vision-Transformers-with-only-2040-images
Official PyTorch implementation of training vision transformers with only 2040 images. 

Paper is available at [[arxiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.10728). 

I have cleaned up the codebase and am re-running the experiments to ensure correctness. Codes will be available in one or two days.
